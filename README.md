# Mars Rovers Challenge

A challenge

## Getting Started

Download mars_on_rover repository to your local machine. Open it with the Terminal (Command Line) with using Ruby:

```
ruby app.rb
```

### Prerequisites

You need to install Ruby

## Installing Ruby (with [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv))

First we need to clean up any previous Ruby installation you might have:

```bash
rvm implode && sudo rm -rf ~/.rvm

rm -rf ~/.rbenv
```

Then in the terminal, run:

```bash
sudo apt install -y build-essential tklib zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libreadline-dev
sudo apt clean
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
```

**Close your terminal and open it again** (Alt+F4 and restart it). If you get a warning, just **ignore** it from now (Ruby is not installed yet).


Now, you are ready to install the latest ruby version, and set it as the default version.

Run this command, it will **take a while (5-10 minutes)**

```bash
rbenv install 2.5.3
```

Once the ruby installation is done, run this command to tell the system
to use the 2.5.3 version by default.

```bash
rbenv global 2.5.3
```

Then **restart** your Terminal again (close it and reopen it).

```bash
ruby -v
```

You should see something starting with `ruby 2.5.3p`.
